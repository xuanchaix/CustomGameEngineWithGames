1.Add three xml editable game modes(kill all enemy, kill opponent, survival), inherit from actor, just like unreal engine
2.Survival mode will generate 5 waves of enemy. Kill them all to win. Whenever you kill an enemy, you will get a dog ally fighting for you. You have 3 lives.
3.Add a UI system for choosing maps
4.Add an enemy(can shoot plasma projectiles)
5.Add an ally(dog, survival mode only, can help you fight against enemies, do not hurt it!)
6.Add a rocket weapon(shoot rocket, blast sphere damage, xml editable, hit effect)
7.AI pathfinding and shortcut choosing
8.Light and Shadow
9.If someone hurt an AI, it will set the damage source as its target and go to attack the source. It's not a bug. I know it and it can be easily fixed, but it is fun, so I keep it and  it becomes a feature.
10.Sometimes an actor has no shadow, it is normal, because the actor is only a quad.
